1.find minimum number of peranthesis need to be added to validate th peranthesis string
Example 1:
Input: s = "())"
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: s = "((("
Output: 3

2. Path with Maximum Gold
In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell,
 0 if it is empty.
Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:
    Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
    From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
    You can't visit the same cell more than once.
    Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
    You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.
Example:
Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.


3.Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree
You are given the root of a full binary tree with the following properties:
Leaf nodes have either the value 0 or 1, where 0 represents False and 1 represents True.
Non-leaf nodes have either the value 2 or 3, where 2 represents the boolean OR and 3 represents the boolean AND.
The evaluation of a node is as follows:

    If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.e. True or False.
    Otherwise, evaluate the node's two children and apply the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.
Example:
Input: root = [2,1,3,null,null,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The above diagram illustrates the evaluation process.
The AND node evaluates to False AND True = False.
The OR node evaluates to True OR False = True.
The root node evaluates to True, so we return true.
